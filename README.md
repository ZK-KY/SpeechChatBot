# SpeechChatBot

This project features a voice-activated AI chatbot that integrates both speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies. Users can interact with the chatbot through spoken input, which is converted to text using the speech_recognition library. The AI model (OllamaLLM) processes the text and generates responses, which are then spoken back to the user using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

Key Features:

 - Convert speech to text with speech_recognition
 - Generate text-to-speech responses using gTTS
 - Real-time interaction for a dynamic conversational experience
